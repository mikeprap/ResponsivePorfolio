            <p>Hello, my name is Michael Praplaski. I'm from Malvern Pennsylvania which is just outside of Philadelphia.
                I have been playing sports my whole entire life and even coached high school lacrosse for about 6 years.
                I still play softball and soccer to try to stay as active as i possibly can. Im currently taking a
                coding bootcamp at UCF so i can pursue a job in web development.</p>
